# Regression-Project-using-R
Predicted transfer value of soccer players by creating regression models
Pre-processed the data and Created histograms, boxplots, etc to understand the dataset.
Used feature selection to build a backward selection model, forward selection model, etc.
Performed Multicollinearity analysis, second-order analysis, Interaction term analysis Residual analysis.
Used Cross-validation to determine model accuracy and finally found out the most effective independent variables to determine transfer value.
